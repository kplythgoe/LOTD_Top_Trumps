// COMPARING THE ATTRIBUTES AND FINDING A WINNER

For example the attribute is age and we have 

Gandalf     2018
Aragorn     88
Arwen       2777
Gollum      589
Frodo        50

Arwen is the winner but how to get to that conclusion

Pass in randomNumber and use vector of attributes?
Example: randomNumber = 2
vector <string> attributes {"ringResistance", "age", "resiliance", "ferocity", "magic", "height"};

NEED TO PUSH CARDS IN PLAY INTO A NEW DECK --> Do that first

finding out who wins

iterate through vector with stats in
find out what the highest card is
check if there are any other cards of the same value --> result will be draw
find the position in the vector of the highest card --> This is the winner
